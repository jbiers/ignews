stripe - payment management

faunaDB - database good for serverless. WHY?

"serverless" - what is it?

prismic CMS - content management system

github oauth - can't register users because app lacks backend (why?)

- single-page application versus server side rendering (LOTS OF CONTENT: products, texts)

- NEXT JS runs in a node server. It does not replace a full-blown backend server, as it is a server with the unique purpose of rendering a layout.

- NextJS works with routes. How does pure react work with routes?
